Hi There,
My name is Vaughn Pieterse. I am a 3rd year Application Development student
and I am currently learning how to work on GitHub.
This is mainly to learn how to upload and showcase my own work and work
done in my groups. Each member in the group will be given recognition for
their efforts. Sharing is caring.
